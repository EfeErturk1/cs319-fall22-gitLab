# cs319-fall22-gitLab
I have some additional commits, in the name of deneme1,2,3
These are caused by the IDE I am using, which is VS. Both Eray and Erdem hoca approved me using VS.
You can check the commit details, it is a commit to .vs/slnx.sqlite, which is a IDE based change in bin (which is a autogenerated file) which is unrelated to the lab project.
So I want to clarify that I did not do anything wrong, this occured because the repo did not have any .gitignore file.
